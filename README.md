## Project Structure
```
face based model/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ indian_playlist.json
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ animations/
    â”œâ”€â”€ happy.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ sad.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ angry.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ neutral.json
    â””â”€â”€ surprise.json
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Lottie Animations
- Place mood Lottie files (happy.json, sad.json, angry.json, neutral.json, surprise.json) in the `animations/` folder directly inside your main project directory (`face based model/animations/`).
- You can get free Lottie files from [lottiefiles.com](https://lottiefiles.com/).
- **Update your `script.js` paths as follows:**
  ```js
  const lottieFiles = {
    happy: 'animations/happy.json',
    sad: 'animations/sad.json',
    angry: 'animations/angry.json',
    neutral: 'animations/neutral.json',
    surprise: 'animations/surprise.json',
  };
  ```

### 3. Run the Backend
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Open the Frontend
- Open `index.html` in your browser (for local Flask, use a simple server or set up CORS).
- Or, deploy both backend and frontend to a service like Render or Hugging Face Spaces.

## Deployment
- For public deployment, serve both backend and frontend from the same domain or configure CORS.
- You can use [Render](https://render.com/) or [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) for free hosting.

## Customizing Playlists
- Edit `indian_playlist.json` to add your favorite songs for each mood and language.
